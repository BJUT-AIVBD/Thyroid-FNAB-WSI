## Introduction
A self-constructed Thyroid-FNAB-WSI cell cluster dataset designed for multi-label classification of thyroid cell clusters, which collected and collated thyroid FNAB cytological smears (Thinprep2000, H&E stained) from the Department of Pathology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Science and Technology from January 2022 to December 2022.There were five classes of cellular features, including irregular nuclear membrane (Class 0), prominent nucleolus (Class 1), nuclear inclusion body (Class 2), nuclear grooves (Class 3), and karyomegaly (Class 4).

## Download the dataset
The way to download the  cell cluster dataset is stored in the "Thyroid_cell_cluster_dataset".
